Some sample text.

Following the `Markdown Guide`, I messed up a bit in the creation of these. I went to `StackEdit.io` to test before publication.
- as visible, errors still happpened.
However, I saw that they had a sequence diagram. I've just pieced together that I could publish a TCP sequence diagram onto github via md files.

That's pretty neat
: if I understood them past Intro to Networking.

### Thanks!
